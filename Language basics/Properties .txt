Properties:- 

*** Stored Properties:- 
struct Car { 
 let make: String
 let color: String 
} 

The two properties of Car are stored properties, which means they store actual string values for each instance of Car.


*** Computed properties:- 

Some properties calculate values rather than store them. In other words, thereâ€™s no actual memory allocated for them; instead, they get calculated on-the-fly each time you access them

E.g.

struct TV {
  var height: Double
  var width: Double
  
  // 1
  var diagonal: Int {
    // 2
    let result = (height * height +
      width * width).squareRoot().rounded()
    // 3
    return Int(result)
  }
}

This is called read-only computed property.
